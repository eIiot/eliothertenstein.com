Welcome to my personal website! This site is inspired by a bunch of other cool portfolio websites that I think are awesome, mainly https://brianlovin.com. Inspiration was also drawn from https://www.sj.land/.

My goal with this site was to keep it functional, while also coding as much as possible myself (for example, the command palette is 100% custom). It's been an awesome learning experience so far, and I hope to keep innovating, and adding new stuff in the future!

Enjoy :)
